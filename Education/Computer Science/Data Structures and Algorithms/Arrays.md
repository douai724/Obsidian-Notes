"Array" can mean something different between languages. For example, Python uses "lists" instead of arrays, which are extremely lenient. Initialization is as easy as `arr = []`, and you don't need to worry about the type of data you store in the list or the size of the list. Other languages like C++ require you to specify the size and data type of the array during initialization, but also have support for lists (like `std::vector` in C++).
