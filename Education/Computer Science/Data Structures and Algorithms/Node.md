A node can be thought of as an element, but with more information than just one piece of data, like an integer or string. Nodes are an abstract idea - for example, let's say you had an arrayÂ `[1, 2, 3]`. You could imagine each element as a node with two pieces of information: the integer, and the index. So the second element would be something like
- data: 2
- index: 1
