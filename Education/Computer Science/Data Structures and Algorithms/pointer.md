a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable or object in a computer's memory. Pointers are used to indirectly access memory locations, allowing a program to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory as needed, and to share data between different parts of a program.

A pointer is often represented as a hexadecimal number that indicates the memory address it points to. By manipulating pointers, a program can directly access the memory locations that store data and can modify or retrieve the data at those locations.

Pointers are commonly used in programming languages like C and C++, but they also exist in other languages like Java and Python, where they are hidden from the programmer.
