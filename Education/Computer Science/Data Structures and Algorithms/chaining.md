When using chaining, we store linked lists inside the hash map's array instead of the elements themselves. The linked list nodes store both the key and the value. If there are collisions, the collided key-value pairs are linked together in a linked list. Then, when trying to access one of these key-value pairs, we traverse through the linked list until the key matches.
