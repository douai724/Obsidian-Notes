- After the reaction, the substrate "inverts" in a Sn2 reaction when the nucleophile bonds with the substrate from the back. (essentially if Sn2 occurs in a chiral centre, it will necessarily invert the stereochemistry there.)
$Rate = k[substrate][nucleophile]$

| Rate | substrate | nucleophile |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| x2   | x2        |             |
| x2   |           | x2          |
| x6   | x2        | x3          |
| x12  | x3        | x4          |
|      |           |             |
