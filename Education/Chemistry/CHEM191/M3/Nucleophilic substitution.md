### The Solvent
The biological medium for chemical reactions is generally H2O. H2O is a polar solvent. Also, able to form [[hydrogen bonds]] (Module 1).

***SN1***: 
- *SN1 fastest in polar solvents*, particularly those which H-bond. First transition state stabilized by: 
	- polar effect at C 
	- H-bonding to LG

***SN2***: 
- Solvent can influence Nu:– through H-bonding These solvent molecules must be removed for the nucleophile to attack – *this lessens its nucleophilicity*.

### Key reaction conditions
- weak nucleophiles are often polar protic solvents and favour Sn1, therefore, where we see an acid as a reactant or product = Sn1.
- Reactions that take place under neutral or basic conditions = Sn2.

In both substitution mechanisms the loss of the leaving group occurs in the rate-determining step, so a ‘good’ leaving group is desirable.

## ![[Leaving Group]]


***SN2***:
- Nu:– binds as leaving group departs
- Strong Nu:– can make up for poor leaving group 

***SN1***: 
- Only change occurring in slow step is cleavage of C-X bond
- *Good leaving groups are essential*.
