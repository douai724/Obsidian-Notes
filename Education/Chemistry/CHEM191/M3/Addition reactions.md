## Mechanism
Initially, the HBr will dissociate into H+ and Br- (HBr will be a strong acid)

1. Slow addition of an electrophile (H+) to the electron rich double bond perpendicular to the atom plane:![[Screen Shot 2023-05-22 at 7.05.04 PM.png]]
2. Fast attack by a nucleophile at the carbocation intermediate: (Just like SN1)![[Screen Shot 2023-05-22 at 7.05.12 PM.png]]
Rate determining step involves the electrophile (electron seeking) - electrophilic addition.
