### Good Leaving Groups
| Good Leaving Group | Conjugate Acid | Conjugate Acid $pk_a$ |
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| I(-)               | HI             | -9.3                  |
| Br(-)              | HBr            | -9.0                  |
| Cl(-)              | HCl            | -8.0                  |
**Weak bases with strong conjugate acids are good leaving groups**

### Poor Leaving Groups
| Poor Leaving Group | Conjugate Acid | Conjugate Acid $pk_a$ |
| ------------------ | -------------- | --------------------- |
| (-)OH              | H2O            | 14                    |
| (-)NH2             | NH3            | 38                    |
| (-)H               | H2             | -36                   |

**Poor leaving groups tend to be strong bases, which are less stable than weak bases out on their own solution**
