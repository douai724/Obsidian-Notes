- Functional groups that are triple-bonded between carbon atoms.

#### Naming Alkynes
To name Alkyenes, we do the same thing as Alkenes. First, we find the longest chain of carbon atoms and pick a root name. 
Then, we number the chain from the end **closest** to the triple bond to let people know where it is, and tack on the suffix *-yne*.
