## Definition
A compound (object) that is **not superimposable** on its mirror image is described as being *chiral*.

Most chiral organic compounds contain an asymmetric carbon atom (**stereocentre**), i.e. *a carbon atom with four different groups attached*.

One way of distinguishing between enantiomers involves their interaction with plane polarized light. The rotation, a, may be measured in a polarimeter. {Optical activity}

A 1:1 mixture of two enantiomers is called a racemate, or a racemic mixture. A racemate: • is designated ( + ), [eg. ( + )-2-butanol] – indicating the presence of both enantiomers • has no specific rotation, ie a = 0° (or "not optically active")

### Absolute Configuration of Asymmetric Carbon
The convention for labelling chiral carbon atoms and assigning the absolute three-dimensional configuration uses sequence rules similar to that described for labelling (Z)- and (E)-isomers of alkenes.

1. Identify the asymmetric C atom;
2. **assign priorities** to the four substituents using *atomic number (Highest = 1, lowest = 4)*
3. draw (or visualise) the structure of the molecule viewed down the bond from C to the substituent with the lowest priority (often H); 
4. If the arrangement of the remaining bonds from 1 to 3 appears **clockwise** *(right-handed), assign R configuration*; if **anticlockwise** *(left-handed) assign S configuration.*

### Diatereoisomers
- *Stereoisomers that are **NOT** enantiomers.* 
- Occur with compounds with *more than* one asymmetric carbon (**stereocentre**). 
- *n Stereocentres have a maximum of 2n stereoisomers.* 
- Diastereomers do **NOT** have similar physical properties (i.e. bp, mp, etc.).
