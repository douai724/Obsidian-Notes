Two possible mechanisms, E1 and E2 - Parallel those for SN1 and SN2. *Elimination mechanism determined by base strength* - strong base - **E2**, weak base - **E1**.

## E1 Mechanism
Rate reaction depends on one molecule, the substrate. (Unimolecular)
1. Like in Sn1, a carbocation intermediate forms on the [[Alpha-Carbons]]
2. a :Base ([[nucleophile]]) takes proton from a [[Beta-carbons]] (the elimination)
3. Then the electrons that were in the beta-hydrogen form a pi-bond and then a double bond forms between the alpha-carbons.

Same rate determining step as SN1, thus same controlling factors: 
- Strong base not required 
- H-bonding solvents promote reaction 
- E1 most common when leaving group is on 3Â° carbon

**E1 and SN1 often co-occur.** 
- Ratio of E1 : SN1, controlled by relative rates of the 2 alternative fast steps. 
- If leaving group is changed, overall rate changes but E1 : SN1 ratio unchanged.

## E2 Mechanism
Rate reaction relies on two molecules, the substrate and the nucleophile. (Bimolecular)
1. Nucleophile (acts as base) takes a beta proton and leaving group leaves.

- Because of reaction rate, strong bases favour E2 reactions
- For most E2 reactions the H and the leaving group must be [[antiperiplanar]]
