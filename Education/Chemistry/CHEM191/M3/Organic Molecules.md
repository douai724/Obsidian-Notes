Most biological molecules are organic. In nature, carbon passes from one system to another - [[the carbon cycle]].

## Drawing Organic molecules

#### Key Points
- **Carbon** atoms form the ***backbone*** of the molecule
- A position where the atom is *not specified* is occupied by a **Carbon**
- Each **Carbon** atom has ***four bonds*** (Four valence electrons)
- If a **Carbon** atom is drawn with *fewer* than four bonds, *the remaining unspecified bonds must be connected to H atoms*

### ![[Functional Groups]]
### Carbon geometry
The three common geometries are tetrahedral like in methane, Trigonal Planar like in methanol, and linear like in acetonitrile. (notice, in all shapes, each carbon atom has four bonds)
- Methane (CH4)
	- **Tetrahedral**
	- 4 single bonds
	- sp3 [[Hybridisation]]
- Methanol (CH2O)
	- **Trigonal Planar**
	- 2 single bonds
	- 1 double bond
	- sp2 [[Hybridisation]]
- acetonitrile (CH3CN)
	- **Linear**
	- 1 single bond
	- 1 triple bond
	- sp [[Hybridisation]]
