#### Key Points
- **Carbon** atoms form the ***backbone*** of the molecule
- A position where the atom is *not specified* is occupied by a **Carbon**
- Each **Carbon** atom has ***four bonds*** 
- If a **Carbon** atom is drawn with *fewer* than four bonds *the remaining unspecified bonds must be connected to H atoms*
