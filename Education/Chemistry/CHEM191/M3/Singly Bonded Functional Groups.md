If X is a good leaving group (C-X bond weak, X can readily accept a pair of electrons from the breaking bond), two types of reactions with nucleophiles are possible:

Example in biological systems: production of adrenaline. (The reaction centre, CH3â€“X, is in bold.) Methyl-group transfer.

**Transition state:** 
- Effective collision has taken place 
- Corresponds to maximum free energy 
- Nu and the X both loosely bound to C (---- partial bond) 
- If its energy (Ea) is high, reaction will be slow.
