- Something with a lone pair or a pi-bond. (has excess electron density)
- Is an active participant in the rate-determining step.

#### Nucleophilicity
describes just how "pushy" the nucleophile is. (measure of affinity towards electrophilic C)

***SN1***: 
- Nu:â€“ not involved in slow step 
- Carbocation reacts readily with any nucleophile 

***SN2***: 
- *Good nucleophile essential.*
