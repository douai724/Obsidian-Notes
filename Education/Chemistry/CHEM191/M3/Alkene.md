- Functional groups are double-bonded between carbons

#### Naming Alkenes
To name an alkene, we must find the longest chain of carbon atoms and it **must** *include a double bond*. Otherwise, it is not named as an alkene.

Remember to number the carbon chain from the end **closest** to the double-bond.

Then, take the lowest number touching the double-bond, combine it with the suffix *-ene* and add that to the root name of our chain.
