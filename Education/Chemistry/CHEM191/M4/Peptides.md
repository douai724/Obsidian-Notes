## Peptide (Amide) bonds

Amino acids are bonded together via [[Nucleophilic substitution]] reactions of the amine group (the [[nucleophile]]) on one with the [[carboxylic acid]] group (the acid derivative) on the other to form peptides. The bond formed is an amide bond, but, in this context, it is called a *peptide bond*.

By convention, when we draw the peptide with the unreacted amine group (**the N-terminal**) on the left and the unreacted carboxylic acid group (**the C-terminal**) on the right.

Due to the resonance structures of the peptide (amide) bond, it is unreactive towards nucleophiles and is planar and rigid – this has important structural implications for the peptide/protein.

The properties of peptides and small proteins largely reflect the properties of the constituent amino acids. 

Eg. In Sickle Cell anaemia, a glutamic acid (which has a polar side chain) is replaced by a valine (which has a non-polar side chain) – this leads to the peptide having lower solubility which in turn leads to deformed red blood cells.

### Structure of peptides and proteins

- <75 amino acids = **peptide**
- >75 amino acids = **protein**

#### Hierarchy of structure
- primary structure: - sequence of AA’s
- secondary structure: - segments off structure along the peptide chain e.g. α-helix, turns, β-sheet 
- tertiary structure: - how secondary structural elements fit together 
- quaternary structure: - how proteins or independent peptide chains come together

Secondary-quaternary structures driven by hydrogen bonding, disulphide bond formation between the side chains of cysteine amino acids, and the general desire to have non-polar amino acids inside and away from the aqueous environment.

### Peptide Synthesis

How to make a specific peptide – remember that ala-gly not the same as gly-ala.

Must use **protecting groups** to temporarily stop groups being able to react – just have the correct amine and carboxylic acid groups combining to form the peptide bond.

“Protect” an amine group with a BOC group (and remove later with acid)

“Protect” a carboxylic acid group with an OMe group (and remove later with base)

Catalyse reaction with DCC (unreactive acid derivative but can't add acid as this will remove BOC protecting group)

### α-helicies and β-sheets

When forming an α-helix or β-sheet the peptide backbone maintains the trans relationship between residues.

Thus, a proline residue disrupts these secondary structural elements.

### Disulfide bridges

Disulfide linkages can also strongly influence the conformation and shape of peptides
