Molecules with rings of atoms which are joined via alternating double and single bonds and, specifically, have either 6 or 10 electrons that are not in sigma bonds, have unusual stability and unusual reactivity – called aromatic compounds.

e.g. In benzene, all the C-C bonds are the same length (not alternating long and short as this structure would suggest) and it doesn’t react like an alkene.

This is a better structure, showing that there is delocalisation of the (6 electrons in the) pi bonds around the whole ring.

### Nitrogen in aromatic compounds
Aromatic ring compounds containing nitrogen instead of carbon are called **heterocyclic compounds**. The aromatic nature of the molecule can affect the acid-base chemistry of the nitrogen.

![[Screen Shot 2023-06-01 at 1.09.06 PM.png | 50]] **Pyridine** has 6 electrons in the three pi bonds so is an aromatic compound. However, the nitrogen still has its lone pair, so it is still able to act as a base.

![[Screen Shot 2023-06-01 at 1.09.02 PM.png | 50]] **Pyrrole** has 4 electrons in the two pi bonds, but if it adds the two electrons in the nitrogen’s lone pair, then it gets the six it needs to be aromatic. When it does this, the nitrogen is no longer basic.

![[Screen Shot 2023-06-01 at 1.08.56 PM.png | 50]] **Imidazole** has two nitrogen atoms in the ring, but again only two pi bonds. So the lone pair of one of the nitrogen’s is taken to make the 6 electrons from the aromatic system (meaning that this nitrogen is not basic) but the other nitrogen keeps its lone pair and so is basic.

#### Fused Systems
![[Screen Shot 2023-06-01 at 1.08.51 PM.png | 70]] **Indole** has two rings which share two atoms (a fused system). In this case the nitrogen lone pair is acquired to make a 10-electron aromatic system.

### Aromatic systems in biological molecules

Aromatic heterocyclic rings are found in many important biological molecules.

Eg ‘Bases’ in DNA and RNA are based on purine and pyrimidine groups.

#### Nucleosides - the bases joined to a ribose sugar group

#### Nucleotides – the nucleosides joined to a phosphate group – the building blocks of DNA and RNA

**ATP** acts by hydrolysis of one of the phosphate bonds – ATP → ADP. Negative charges on the phosphates repel nucleophiles, so the reaction is catalysed by an enzyme and is facilitated by Mg2+.

DNA is much more stable than RNA – again it is the phosphate bond which breaks and the OH group on C2’ acts as an internal nucleophile to facilitate bond breakage in RNA (DNA does not have an OH group at this position.
