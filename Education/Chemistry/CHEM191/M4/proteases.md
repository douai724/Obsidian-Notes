## Chymotrypsin
Chymotrypsin is a proteolytic enzyme (*a serine protease*) found in the digestive system (pancreatic juices)of many organisms. It catalyses the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, specifically the peptide bond on the carboxy side of an aromatic (benzene like) amino acid.

- Chymotrypsin has a hydrophobic binding pocket to recognise the aromatic ring (will also accept other large hydrophobic R groups, e.g. isoleucine).
- This binding site positions the peptide bond for processing at the active site, which contains a “catalytic triad”

## Carboxypeptidase A
- Carboxypeptidase is another protease that is very specific in its mode of action 
- It recognises the carboxylate of the C-terminal amino acid and efficiently hydrolyses the adjacent peptide bond. Thus, it effectively clips off the C— terminal residue and exposes the next one for processing 
- It is an example of a **metalloenzyme**, with Zn2+ playing an integral role at the active site.

3 key factors: 
1. reactants are held close together. 
2. Zn2+ makes C=O more susceptible to nucleophilic attack 
3. H2O is deprotonated to make a better nucleophile

Following the mechanistic arrows get us to the tetrahedral intermediate

This then leads to breaking of the C-N bond liberating the C-terminal amino acid and exposes the next amino acid.

### Why is the OH group of tyrosine in the able to act as a proton donor?
Usually the proton of an alcohol group is not acidic. However the OH group of tyrosine is attached to a benzene ring and this influences its acidity and reactivity.

The reason that OH of phenol is more acidic than that of an aliphatic alcohol is due to the relative stability of its conjugate base, due to resonance stabilisation. (Brown et al., Section 28.4 p1124)- spreading out of the charge similar to acetate.
