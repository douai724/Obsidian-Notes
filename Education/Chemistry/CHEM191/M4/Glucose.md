## C6H12O6

One of the most abundant monosaccharides: 
- Grape sugar 
- Blood sugar (~ 80 mg glucose/100 mL) 

Found naturally in two cyclic hemiacetal forms 
- $\alpha$-D-glucopyranose 
- $\beta$-D-glucopyranose

![[b-D-glucopyranose]]
## Structure of α- and β-D-glucopyranose
$\alpha$ & $\beta$ describe arrangement at anomeric carbon, C-1 
- $\alpha$ is down (opposite side to CH2OH) 
- $\beta$ is up (same side as CH2OH)

### Equilibria in solution
Glucose may be obtained in solid form as either a or b-D-glucopyranose.

In aqueous solution, these interconvert via a chain form:

Cyclic forms are in $eq^m$ with free aldehyde Re-closure can take place with C-1 OH either up or down. This process is called [[MUTAROTATION]].

#### How do we know?
Polarimetry: pure $\alpha [\alpha]_D +112\degree$, pure $\beta [\alpha]_D +19\degree$, equilibrium mixture +53$\degree$

Measuring the rotation of plane polarized light by a solution of glucose shows that the equilibrium mixture is not 1:1, as the final rotation value is not the average.

### Chair Representation Of A Sugar
- Carbons in glucose are tetrahedral 
- Ring systems are not flat (this type of drawing is called a Haworth structure) 
- Better representation of shape - ***chair form***

*Equatorial bonds*: Generally more favourable for a group to be equatorial.
*Axial groups* interact with axial groups on same side of ring.
