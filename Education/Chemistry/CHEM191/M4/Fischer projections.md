## About Fischer projections and how to use them
- 3D structures may be represented in a 2D shorthand form (**Fischer projection**) 
- Chiral carbon represented as a cross piece 
- Draw Fischer projection with the highest oxidised carbon (for glyceraldehyde CHO) at the top The longest carbon chain is the vertical bonds

#### In this orientation: 
- bonds up and down project into the page 
- bonds to the side project out from the page
