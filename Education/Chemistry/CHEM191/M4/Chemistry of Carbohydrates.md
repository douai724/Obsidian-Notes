## Monosaccharides
![[Carbohydrates#Carbohydrates]]

Monosaccharides exist as either **furanoses** (four C’s and one O in the ring) or **pyranoses** (five C’s and one O in the ring. 
- Glucose is a **pyranose** 
- $\alpha$ is down; – OH group on anomeric carbon on opposite side to CH2OH. 
- $\beta$ is up – OH group on anomeric carbon on same side as CH2OH.

Note that the arrangement of the OH groups on carbons 2,3 and 4 are specific to which sugar it is (glucose, galactose etc). You do not need to know how these are arranged for a specific sugar. The CH2OH group is always up for a D sugar, and you then just need to know to correctly draw the OH group on the anomeric carbon as a or b.

## Stereochemistry of natural aldohexoses
Common natural monosaccharides are all (R) at the chiral carbon next to the CH2OH group
- i.e. are all D-sugars 
- Different arrangements at other chiral carbons are given different names

## Hemiacetals and Acetals

[[Chemistry of carbohydrates]] dominated by chemistry of hemiacetals and acetals:

### Cyclic Hemiacetals
If a molecule contains both C=O and OH functional groups it can form a cyclic hemiacetal:

## The Secret To Understanding Carbohydrate Chemistry
1. Find **C** atoms bonded to *two* **O** atoms (normally one in each carbohydrate ring called *anomeric* carbons)                            ![[Screen Shot 2023-05-31 at 7.21.58 PM.png]]
2. Decide for each anomeric carbon whether it is a *hemiacetal* or an **acetal**

## Cyclic Structure
The common monosaccharides exist in cyclic hemiacetal forms with either:
- Furanoses
	- 4x **C** and 1x **O**
	- 5 membered ring
- pyranoses
	- 5x **C** and 1x **O**
	- six member ring
	- (More stable than 5 membered rings)

## Carbohydrates and Molecular Recognition

Tremendous scope for variability - many combinations and permutations that can give unique patterns on cell surfaces.

- Lock and key recognitions involving complex carbohydratebased structures implicated in many processes taking place at cell surfaces 
- Invading viruses frequently hijack these mechanisms to gain entry into cells 
- e.g. influenza virus targets a specific carbohydrate sequence


*Monosaccharides units can differ in:*
- Number of carbons: generally 8 to 4.
- Stereochemistry: 8 common D-aldohexoses
- Functional groups: NH2, COOH
- Ring size: furanose and pyranose
- Orientation of groups: $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

### Blood groups compatibility
Normal healthy individuals, from early in childhood, make red cell antibodies against A or B antigens that are not expressed on their own cells. These naturally occurring antibodies are mainly IgM immunoglobulins. They attack and rapidly destroy red cells carrying the corresponding antigen. For example, anti-A attacks red cells of Group A or AB. Anti-B attacks red cells of Group B or AB.
