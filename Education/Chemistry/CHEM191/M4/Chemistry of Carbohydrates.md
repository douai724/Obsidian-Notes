Monosaccharides exist as either **furanoses** (four C’s and one O in the ring) or **pyranoses** (five C’s and one O in the ring. 
- Glucose is a **pyranose** 
- $\alpha$ is down; – OH group on anomeric carbon on opposite side to CH2OH. 
- $\beta$ is up – OH group on anomeric carbon on same side as CH2OH.

Note that the arrangement of the OH groups on carbons 2,3 and 4 are specific to which sugar it is (glucose, galactose etc). You do not need to know how these are arranged for a specific sugar. The CH2OH group is always up for a D sugar, and you then just need to know to correctly draw the OH group on the anomeric carbon as a or b
