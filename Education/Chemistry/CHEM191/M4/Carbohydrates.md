- Glucose â€“ C6H12O6 equivalent to (C.H2O)6 
- Term saccharide relates to sweetness (sugars)

Within the body their functions are:
- Providing energy and regulation of blood glucose 
- Sparing the use of proteins for energy 
- Breakdown fatty acids and preventing ketosis 
- Biological recognition processes 
- Flavour and sweeteners 
- Dietary fibre

## Monosaccharides

Simple sugars that cannot be broken down into more simple sugars
