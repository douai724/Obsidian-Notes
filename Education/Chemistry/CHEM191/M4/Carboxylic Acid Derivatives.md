One single-bond to carbonyl C is relatively easy to break.

- Geometry similar to aldehydes/ketones
- consequence of **L** group is that C of C=O can be further polarized:

More electron-withdrawing means more reactive - attractive to *Nu:–*

Amides are the least reactive due to resonance structures.

## Preparation of Reactive Carboxylic Acid Derivatives

#### Acid Chlorides

#### Anhydrides

### Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution with Reactive Acid Derivatives (acid chlorides and anhydrides)

$\delta$+ on C of C=O is sufficient to attract weak and strong nucleophiles 
- With weak nucleophiles a deprotonation step is required

Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution with *UNREACTIVE* Acid Derivatives (amides, carboxylic acids and esters) with Neutral Nucleophiles:
- Generally, d+ on C of C=O is not sufficiently strong to attract Nu-H. Need to activate C=O with E+ (H+). 
	- H+ acts as a catalyst 
	- eg Ester formation

#### **Acid derivatives are found in many biological molecules:**

Lipids contain ester functional groups – one important type, called triglycerides, have the following structure:

At room temperature most triglycerides are solids – Fats – which can be broken down by reaction with OH- to form soaps

Molecules which have a long alkyl chain and a charges group at the end can form structured assemblies in water, driven by the desire for the (hydrophilic) charged group to want be solvated by the water and the (hydrophobic) alkyl chain wanting to be away from the water.

Three main types:
- Bilayer sheet (cell membranes)
- Micelle (soap)
- liposomes (liposome drug delivery)
