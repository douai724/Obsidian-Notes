Two glucose units joined through C-1 of left hand sugar to the O at C-4 of the right hand sugar. Thus a 1,4-glycosidic linkage 

The glycosidic bond from C-1 (anomeric carbon) is pointing down while the CH2OH is up Thus an Î±-1,4-glycosidic linkage

*Left hand sugar contains an acetal group*

*Right hand* sugar contains a *hemiacetal*. This is in equilibrium with the open chain aldehyde form of the right hand sugar. Thus, maltose is a **REDUCING** Sugar
