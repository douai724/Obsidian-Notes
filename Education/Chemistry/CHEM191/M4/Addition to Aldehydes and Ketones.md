- [[Nucleophile]] attacks in the first step (**Rate determining**)
- [[Electrophile]] attacks in the second step (fast)

## For weak nucleophiles

- Increase reactivity by increasing positive charge on Carbon
- Usually acid catalysed (E+ is H+).
- Electrophile attacks in the first step (fast)
- Nucleophile attacks in the second step (rate determining)

## [[Aldehyde]] vs. [[Ketone]]

Aldehydes are more reactive than ketones. 
The C of ketone is less attractive to nucleophiles: 
- ***Steric***: less hindered for the aldehyde. Aldehydes have at least one (small) H substituent. Ketones have two bulky substituents. 
- ***Electronic***: electron donating alkyl groups reduce d+ charge on C of C=O. **Ketones have two groups, aldehydes have one.**

#### Example
Weak nucleophile: addition of alcohols (ROH), H+ catalysed, gives a hemiacetal.

Hemiacetals can react with a second alcohol molecule to give an acetal. “SN1 like” substitution of OH, H+ catalysed, CH3OH neutral nucleophile.

## Addition of amino compounds G-NH2

Amines are stronger nucleophiles that alcohols

further reaction under the same conditions to form an **imine** - “E1 like” elimination of H2O

Overall reaction: condensation reaction (water is eliminated)

#### Biological example

These reversible reactions are common in biological systems, in particular for reversibly attaching compounds to proteins. For example 11-cis-retinal (a light absorbing, or chromophore, derived from vitamin A) is reversibly attached to a protein called opsin to give Rhodopsin, a key component in vision. 

Different opsins give different photoreceptors optimized for different colours, which gives colour vision. 

On absorbtion of light; cis –> trans.
