Key reaction that reflects the equilibrium:

- Small % of molecules with a free aldehyde group Þ easily oxidized

## [[Oxidation]] – reducing sugars

If reaction of a sugar with Ag+ under basic conditions gives solid Ag metal: 
- there must be some free –CHO in solution. 
- i.e. the sugar must be in a hemiacetal form. 
- such a sugar (e.g. D-glucose) is called a reducing sugar.

However in the absence of $H^+$, this reaction cannot occur, why?

Because -OR is a [[poor leaving group]]

Note:
- This substitution reaction is *reversible* 
- Nucleophile can attack from *either side* of a carbocation intermediate 
- Both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ glycosides (**acetals**) are formed

The pure glycosides dissolved in H2O in absence of strong acid:
- stable 
- no open chain form possible -- no equilibrium 
- no reaction with Ag+ 
- have a non-reducing sugar
