Polymer of glucose with b-1,4 glycosidic bonds. Skeletal material for cell walls. 
- wood ~ 50% cellulose 
- cotton ~ 100% cellulose

Geometry of these linkages leads to straight molecular rods stabilised by a network of hydrogen bonds – useful for structural material

Mammals without a rumen can not digest cellulose Digestive enzymes have reactive sites which are the right shape for α-1,4’-glycosidic linkages β-1,4’-glycosidic links do not fit.
