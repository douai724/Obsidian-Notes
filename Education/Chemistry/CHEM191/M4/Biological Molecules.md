## Four major classes of biological molecules
- [[Carbohydrates]]
- [[Lipids]]
- [[Proteins]]
- [[Nucleic acids]]

Each is an important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions. 

Combined, these molecules make up the majority of a cellâ€™s mass. Biological molecules are organic, meaning that they contain **carbon**. In addition, they may contain hydrogen, **oxygen**, **nitrogen**, **phosphorus**, **sulfur**, and additional minor elements.
