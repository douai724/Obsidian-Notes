## About
Amino Acids contain two functional groups – an amine and a carboxylic acid – and one of 20 side chains (R).

All amino acids are chiral (the central C, called the a carbon, is an asymmetric centre), and so have enantiomers – EXCEPT glycine which has R = H. 

Fisher projections of amino acids have the COOH group at the top and the R group at the bottom. The position of the NH2 group then determines if the amino acid is D or L. (NH2 on left = L)

### Amino Acids and [[Acid-base Chemistry]]
Each functional group has a pKa value, associated with its ability to donate a H+ to water.

-COOH + H2O ⇌ -COO- + H3O+ pKa = about 2.5 *most easily deprotonated*
-NH3+ + H2O ⇌ -NH2 + H3O+ pKa = about 9.5 *less easily deprotonated*

A titration of an acidic solution of an amino acid shows that the amino acid changes from H3N+ -CHR-COOH → H3N+ -CHR-COO- → H₂ N-CHR-COO-, so at intermediate (i.e. physiological) pH the [[Zwitterions]] from is present in solution. 

The **pI** is the average of the two pKa values. If the amino acid has an R group which itself has a functional group with a pKa value, then the **pI** is the average of the two most similar pKa values.
