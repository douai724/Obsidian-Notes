#### Definition
solubility is a measurement of how much of a solid dissolves in a given amount of solvent. The solid will dissolve until reaching a maximum value of “s”. At this point, the solution is considered saturated (equilibrium between solute(s) and solute(aq)). Solubility is also defined as equilibrium concentration of a solute.

##### Factors of how much a solute dissolves
How much a solute dissolves depends on the chemical nature of the solute, temperature, and pressure if the solute is a gas.
##### Solubility product
Some ionic solids are sparingly soluble, and an equilibrium is formed between the dissolved and Non-dissolved ions. This equilibrium constant is called the solubility product and is given the symbol $K_{sp}$
- Equilibrium Equation for sparingly soluble salts → $AB(s) \leftrightarrows A^+(aq)+B^-(aq)$, $K_{sp} = [A^+]_e[B^-]_e = (s)\times(s) = s^2$
-   How can we tell if precipitate will form? Upon mixing a solution of a cation with a solution of an anion, a $Q_{sp}$ Can be immediately recorded during the instant of mixing. Comparison of this $Q_{sp}$ Value and the $K_{sp}$ Can tell us whether a precipitate will form.
    -   If $Q_{sp}>K_{sp}$… a precipitate will form.
    -   If $Q_{sp}<K_{sp}$… a precipitate will not form.
##### Common ion effect
If a sparingly soluble salt is introduced into a solution with either a cation or anion from the salt (common ion), it will decrease the solubility of the salt(s). Note: $K_{sp}$ does not change when this occurs.
