#### Definition
-   An enzyme is a substance that acts as a [catalyst](https://www.britannica.com/science/catalyst) in living organisms, regulating the rate at which [chemical reactions](https://www.britannica.com/science/chemical-reaction) proceed without itself being altered in the process.

#### What is an enzyme?
-   The biological processes that occur within all living organisms are chemical reactions, and most are regulated by enzymes.
-   Without enzymes, many of these reactions would not take place at a perceptible rate.
-   Enzymes catalyse all aspects of cell metabolism. This includes the digestion of food, in which large nutrient molecules (such as proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) are broken down into smaller molecules; the conservation and transformation of chemical energy; and the construction of cellular macromolecules from smaller precursors.
-   Many inherited human diseases, such as [albinism](https://www.britannica.com/science/albinism) and [phenylketonuria](https://www.britannica.com/science/phenylketonuria), result from a deficiency of a particular enzyme.
