- The majority of acids and bases, especially those found in biological systems, are weak acids and bases. These are acids and bases that only partially donate or accept protons, forming equilibrium mixtures.
-   $K_a$ Is the acidity Constant
-   $K_b$ Is the basicity Constant
-   A large value of $K_a$ or $K_b$ Indicates a large degree of dissociation And therefore a stronger weak acid or base.
    -   This can also be written as $pK_a$ or $pK_b$. Equation: $pK_a = -logK_a$, where the smaller the $pK_a$ The greater degree of dissociation and the stronger the weak acid; this can also be applied to $pK_b$
-   The strength of a weak acid is related to its conjugate base. For a weak acid, ($HA$) and its conjugate base ($A^-$):
    -   $K_a(HA)\times K_b(A^-) = K_w$ And $pK_a(HA) + pK_b(A^-)=pK_w=14$

##### Calculation of pH of weak acid and weak base solutions
-   The [[pH]] of the solution of a weak acid can be calculated using the $K_a$ Expression for the weak acid and then making the following assumptions.
    -   $[H_3O]^+_e=[conjugate\space base]_e$
    -   $[weak\space acid]_e = [weak\space acid]_i$
-   The assumption that all the $H_3O^+$ In the solution comes from the dissociation of the weak acid (and not the Autoprotolysis reaction of water) is normally appropriate. Although…→both sources of $H_3O^+$ Must be considered if the initial concentration of the acid is very low ($<10^{-6}\space mol\space L^{-1}$)
