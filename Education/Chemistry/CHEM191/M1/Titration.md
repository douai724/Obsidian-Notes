### Definition
Also known as acid-base titration, it is an experimental technique used to find the concentration of some species in a solution through its reaction with another species in a solution of known concentration.

---

#### Common Titration curve order:
- concentration before Titration (start).
- Added base ($OH^-$) converts acid into its conjugate base.
- The acid is neutralised by the base (equivalence point).
- There is no acid left to react with excess $OH^-$

#### Diprotic acid

##### What is the nature of Diprotic acids when titrated?â†“
- if an acid has 2 protons it can donate, it will do so one at a time.
