## Polar and Non-polar molecules

### Polar Molecules
a *hydrophilic* molecule which contains a *polar bond* (A bond between two atoms which has significantly different electronegative charges) ‒ typical bonds of this type include: O-H, N-H, C-O.

### Non-Polar Molecules
A **hydrophobic** molecule which only contains a *non-polar bond* (A bond between two atoms with similar electronegative charges) ‒ Typical bonds of this type include: C-C, C-H

- _Water is a polar molecule._

- _Alcohol remains intact and does not ionise._

### "Like dissolves Like."
It means interactions between polar molecules and other polar molecules are possible, and interactions Between Non-polar and Non-polar molecules are possible.

## Solvation of Polar Molecules

_Ions are solvated by water_ ‒ they form a *hydrogen shell* around the ion, where the water molecules orient themselves to maximise the **positive** and **negative** attraction between the **ion** and the **partial charge** of the water molecule.

Polar molecules form [[dipole-dipole interaction]] with water molecules, often these are very strong and so are known as hydrogen bonds.

The nature of polar molecules enables *electrostatic interaction* with charged molecules, this process is Also known as [[hydration]].

##### Hydrogen bonding in biology
Hydrogen bonding is extremely important in biology ‒ it drives the generation of the three-dimensional shape of proteins and the assembly of DNA and RNA. It also plays an important role in the actions of many enzymes.

##### The role of pH in the Solvation of Polar Molecules
A functional group in a molecule can be protonated or deprotonated depending on the pH of the solution the mole is in and the $pK_a$ Of the functional group.

## Ionisable Functional Groups

_Important for the interaction of biological molecules_

-   When $[A^-]=[HA],\space pH = pK_a$
-   If 1 pH above $pK_a$, 90% of molecules are protonated
-   If 1 pH below $pK_a$, 90% of molecules are deprotonated

#### ![[Proteins]]
Most of the a-amino and a-carboxyl groups on amino acids are involved in these bonds and not available for ionisation. As such, they rely on Ionisable..→side chain groups (R-groups) and the N- and C-termini (end of chain).

![[Buffer Solutions#Buffer solutions]]

Biological systems require a particular ionisation state and charge, which is controlled by pH

### ![[enzymes#Definition]]
Ionisation state of amino acid side chains is crucial for the operation of enzymes.

## Solvation of non-polar molecules
Non-polar molecules are *not* well solvated by polar molecules, as such, they tend to aggregate with themselves.

Molecules that contain **both** *polar* and *non-polar* molecules will assemble into structures in water. Where the *polar* parts are ==on the outside== interacting with the water, while the *Non-polar* parts are ==in the centre== interacting with themselves. Membranes are formed this way. I.e. phospholipids

### Membranes
-   The Non-polar Membrane can have other Non-polar molecules embedded into it.
-   The Membrane also stops polar molecules from crossing it, unless the appropriate channels are available.
