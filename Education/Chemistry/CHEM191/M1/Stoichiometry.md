### The Mole

The simple definition of a Mole is atoms or molecules in precise groups with variable mass. The exact number of atoms in a single mole is $6.022*10^{23}$ also known as [[Avogarda's Constant]].

##### Molar Mass 
- Mass of a particular atom or molecule measured in moles or $gmol^{-1}$.
- Equation to find the amount in moles is: $n=\frac m M$.
- Equation to find the concentration of solute dissolved per volume of solvent: $c=\frac n V$.

### Limiting reactant (or Reagents)

The first reactant to run out during a chemical reaction.

##### The "Other in excess"

The reactant that is left when the limiting reactant runs out.
