### Lewis Acids and Bases
- A Lewis acid is a proton pair acceptor
- A lewis base is a proton pair donor
### Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
- A Brønsted-Lowry Acid is a proton ($H^+$) donor
- A Brønsted-Lowry Base is a proton ($H^+$) accepter
- When an acid donates its proton to another molecule, all that remains is called the **conjugate base** of the *acid*. (As it could potentially regain the proton).
- When a base accepts a proton from an acid, it becomes a new molecule called the **conjugate acid** Of the *base*.

-   **Acids** are Molecules that contain a Hydrogen atom connected to an electronegative element, common atoms related to this are oxygen or a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I)
-   **Bases** are molecules that contain a lone pair of electrons, usually an oxygen or a nitrogen.

#### Autoprotolysis
- The idea that water can act as an acid or a base. The Autoprotolysis constant is $K_w$ (Also known as the auto-ionisation constant).

#### Quantifying Acidity
- $pOH = -log[OH^-]$ 
- Given $K_w=[H_3O^+]_e[OH^-]=1\times 10^{-14}$ At $25\textdegree C$, we can mathematically rearrange to get→$pH + pOH = 14$ At $25\textdegree C$
- The pH scale runs from 1 to 14 in water
	- If the pH is less than 7, there is more $H_3O^+$ Than $OH^-$ And the solution is considered acidic.
	- If the pH is greater than 7, there is more $OH^-$ Than $H_3O^+$ And the solution is considered basic (or alkaline)

#### Quantifying Basicity
-   To quantify the basicity of a solution, we use
    -   $pOH = -log[OH^-]$
    -   Given $K_w=[H_3O^+]_e[OH^-]=1\times 10^{-14}$ At $25\degree C$, we can mathematically rearrange to get→$pH + pOH = 14$ At $25\degree C$.
    -   Note: is the temperature is changed, then the value of $K_w$ will also change, and the above relationships will change.

#### Acid and Base Strength
- A strong acid is one where all molecules with donate their protons to water in aqueous solutions ‒ they undergo complete dissociation.
- A strong base is one where all molecules will accept a proton.
- Acids (or bases) that only partially accept/donate protons, and forming equilibrium mixtures are called weak Acids (bases).
