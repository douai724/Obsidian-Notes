## Enthalpy
When a chemical reaction happens, *heat* (**q**) is either absorbed or released by the reaction. $$Heat(q)=q_{products}-q_{reactants}$$
-   The ***Enthalpy (H)*** is the thermodynamic property that describes the *heat content of a system* measured in J or kJ in conditions of constant pressure.
-   The *change* in ***enthalpy $(\triangle H)$*** can be determined by measuring how much heat is *absorbed or released* in a chemical reaction. $\triangle H=H(final)-H(initial)$ , same as $\triangle H=H_{products}-H_{reactants}$
    -   If heat is **absorbed** by the reaction, $\triangle H$ will be *positive* and the reaction is called *endothermic*.
    -   If heat is **released** by the reaction, $\triangle H$ will be *negative* and the reaction is called *exothermic*.
-   ***Enthalpy*** is used to calculate the heat absorbed or released during a chemical process. To calculate use, $q=\triangle H$, where **q** is the *amount of heat exchanged with the surroundings.*
