### Definition
Hybridisation is the concept in chemistry that describes the mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals, which can explain the molecular geometry and bonding in molecules.

---

***In a double bonded molecule,*** such as **ethane (C2H4)**, the carbon atoms are *sp2 hybridised*. This means that **each carbon atom** has *three hybrid orbitals that are involved in bonding with the other carbon atom and the two hydrogen atoms*. The remaining **unhybridised p-orbital** on each carbon atom forms a **pi-bond** that ***overlaps*** with the *pi-bond* of the other carbon atom to create the **double bond**.

***In a triple bonded molecule,*** such as **ethyne (C2H2)**, the carbon atoms are sp hybridised. This means that **each carbon atom** has *two hybrid orbitals that are involved in bonding with the other carbon atom and one hydrogen atom.* The remaining **two unhybridised p-orbitals** on each carbon atom form **two pi-bonds** that ***overlap*** with the **[[pi-bonds]]** of the other carbon atom to create the **triple bond**.

***Single bonds*** contain one [[Sigma-bond]] (*longer bond*)

***Double bonds*** contain one **sigma bond** and one **pi bond**

***Triple bonds*** contain one **sigma bond** and two **pi bonds** (*shorter bond*)
