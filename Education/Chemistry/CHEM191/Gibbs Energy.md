### ***Gibb's energy = ΔG***

The **change in Gibbs Energy** (ΔG) in a chemical reaction provides an *indication of whether a reaction is spontaneous in a particular direction*.
- If (***ΔG***) is **negative**, then the *reaction is spontaneous*
- If (***ΔG***) is **positive**, the *reaction is not spontaneous*
- If (***ΔG***) is **zero**, the *reaction is at Equilibrium*
### ![[Gibbs free energy change]]
### Coupled reactions as it relates to Gibbs energy
The concept of ***coupled reactions*** is related to Gibbs energy because *the spontaneity of one reaction can drive the non-spontaneous reaction by providing the energy required to overcome the activation energy barrier*. The [[Gibbs free energy change]] (ΔrG) for the overall process determines whether the coupled reactions will occur spontaneously or not.
- If the [[Gibbs free energy change]] for the overall process is **negative**, *then the coupled reactions are spontaneous and can occur without the need for external energy input.* In this case, the *energy* released by the *exergonic (energy-releasing) reaction* is used to drive the *endergonic (energy-requiring) reaction*.
- Conversely, if the [[Gibbs free energy change]] for the overall process is **positive**, then *the coupled reactions are non-spontaneous and require external energy input to occur*. In this case, the *energy input* is used to drive the *endergonic reaction*, which then provides the energy required for the *exergonic reaction*.

### Relating K, Q and ΔrG

Another way to calculate the [[Gibbs free energy change]] with the equilibrium constant (K) or Reaction Quotient (Q): ΔrG = ΔG° + RT ln(Q)
- where ΔG° is the **standard Gibbs free energy change**, R is the **gas constant**, T is the **temperature** in Kelvin, and ln(Q) is the natural logarithm of the **reaction quotient**.

At equilibrium, the reaction quotient is equal to the equilibrium constant, so Q = K. Therefore, the equation can be simplified as: ΔrG = ΔG° + RT ln(K)
- If ΔG is **negative**, the reaction is *spontaneous and proceeds in the forward direction*.
- If ΔG is **positive**, the reaction is *non-spontaneous in the forward direction and will proceed in the reverse direction*.
- If ΔG is **zero**, the system is at *equilibrium*.

_**These methods are used to calculate ΔrG in non-standard conditions.**_

***Overall***, the [[Gibbs free energy change]] is a useful concept in predicting the spontaneity of chemical reactions and determining the equilibrium state of a system.
