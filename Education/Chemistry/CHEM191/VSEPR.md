"Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion Theory"

VESPR Theory states that the **shape of the molecule** will be one where the sets of electrons around the central atom will be *as far apart from each other as possible*. Various limiting arrangements are possible, depending on how many sets of electrons there are.

| Sets of electron pairs | Number of outer atoms | Lone pairs | Geometry        | Molecular Shape    | Bond Angles | Molecule                                              |
