*Most [[redox reactions]] occur in either a neutral or acidic solution.*

One the species constituting the half equations have been determined, balance each half first for atoms and then for electrons. 
**In acidic solutions**, balance oxygens by adding water, and balance hydrogens by adding $H^+$. 
Then add the half equations together such that the electrons completely cancel out.
