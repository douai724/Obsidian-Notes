-   The standard enthalpy of formation, denoted as ΔHf°, is the enthalpy change that occurs when→one mole of a compound is formed from its constituent elements in their standard states at a defined reference temperature and pressure (usually 298 K and 1 atm).
-   The standard enthalpy of formation is a useful tool for comparing the relative stabilities of different compounds.
    -   If the ΔHf° value of a compound is negative,→it means that the compound is more stable than its constituent elements.
    -   If the ΔHf° value is positive,→it means that the compound is less stable than its constituent elements.
-   For example, the standard enthalpy of formation of water (H2O) is -285.8 kJ/mol. This negative value indicates that water is more stable than its constituent elements, hydrogen and oxygen gas. Conversely, the standard enthalpy of formation of molecular oxygen (O2) is 0 kJ/mol, indicating that O2 is equally stable as its constituent elements, and the standard enthalpy of formation of ozone (O3) is 142.7 kJ/mol, indicating that O3 is less stable than its constituent elements.
-   How to calculate the Enthalpy change of a chemical reaction→ΔH° = ∑(nΔHf°)(products) - ∑mΔHf°(reactants), where n and m are the Stoichiometric coefficients of the products and reactants, respectively. $$\triangle H\degree = \sum (\triangle_f H \degree_{products})-\sum (\triangle_f H \degree_{reactants})$$
