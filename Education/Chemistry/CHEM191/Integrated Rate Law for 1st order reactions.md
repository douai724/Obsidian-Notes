### [[1st order reactions]]
Where $[A]t$ is the **concentration** of the reactant at time **t**, $[A]0$ is the **initial concentration** of the reactant, $k$ is the *rate constant* of the reaction, and ln represents the natural logarithm.â†’$ln(\frac {[A]t} {[A]0})=-kt$

### The half-life of a first order reaction
The **time it takes for half the reactant to be consumed**, and is given by: $t\frac 1 2 = -ln(0.5)/k$, *where ln(0.5) is the natural logarithm of 2 which is approximately equal to 0.693.*
