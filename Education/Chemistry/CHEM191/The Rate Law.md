*The rate law will be→$rate=k[A]^x[B]^y$, where $k$ is the **rate constant** for the reaction and x and y are the **orders of the reaction.***

---

The values of the **orders** (**x and y**) can only be determined *experimentally*. Cannot be found via the stoichiometry of the reaction.
- If *x + y = 0*, ***Zero* order reaction**, *rate* = $k$, unit of k is $mol\space L^{-1}\space s^{-1}$
- If *x + y = 1*, [[1st order reactions]], *rate* = $k[A]$, unit of k is $s^{-1}$
- If *x + y = 2*, ***Second* order reaction**, *rate* = $k[A][B]$ or *rate* = $k[A]^2$, unit of k is $mol\space L^{-1}\space s^{-1}$

### Pseudo first order reactions
A reaction relies on the *concentration of two reactants* (**A and B**). But if one of the *concentrations* (B) is much *higher*, then $[B]$ will approximately constant when the reaction occurs. *The rate law will become: rate = $k’[A]$ where $k’[B]$ = constant number.* 
***Thus, the reaction will appear as a first order one ‒ called a pseudo first order reaction.***

### Experimental determination of the rate law
##### The method of initial rates
[[The rate of Reaction]] will proceed in a non-linear way throughout the reaction, but will *initially appear linear*. 
Thus, measuring the concentration of a reactant or product with in the **initial stages** of a reaction will be a *convenient way to measure the rate*.
##### Regular Method
To experimentally determine the orders with respect to each of the reactants, we deliberately change the concentrations of each of the reactants in turn and see how it affects the [[The rate of Reaction]].
