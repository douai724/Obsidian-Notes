### Definition
Electron transfer reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one species to another. In these reactions, *one species loses electrons* (**oxidation**) while another *gains electrons* (**reduction**). The species that *loses electrons* is called the **oxidizing agent**, while the species that *gains electrons* is called the r**educing agent**.
