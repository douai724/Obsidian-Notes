##### Equilibrium
when a reaction between reactants and products seem to slow to a standstill, at this point, reactants are still being turned into products and products back into reactants. When this situation occurs, the reaction has reached **chemical equilibrium**.

Equilibrium constant equation: $K_c=\frac{(C)^c(D)^d (product)}{(A)^a(B)^b(reactant)}$

![[Le Chatelier's Principle]]

$K_c$ **only** depends on temperature, not starting concentration.

Pure solids and pure liquids never appear in the equation.

#### An Equilibriums' reaction to change

- If changes alter the concentrations of products or reactants, the solution will no longer be at equilibrium. According to Le Chatelierâ€™s Principle, in response to this change, the system will try to counteract the change and return to equilibrium. ***K becomes Q when change occurs.***
	- If Q change > K (i.e. adding more products to the system) then the position of the equilibrium will move to the left in order to restore equilibrium.
	- If Q change < K (i.e. adding more reactants to the system) then the position of the equilibrium will move to the right in order to restore equilibrium.
- If temperature is changed, K will change. Therefore, a system at one temperature will not be at equilibrium at a different temperature. In turn, it is expected that if there is a shift in the position of the equilibrium, the system will return to equilibrium.
- Catalysts DO NOT affect the position of equilibrium, why? They merely speed up the rate the system reaches equilibrium.
