## Definition
In chemistry, **spontaneity** refers to the *tendency of a chemical reaction to occur without any external influence or intervention*. A spontaneous reaction is one that occurs naturally and *without the need for an input of energy.*

***The spontaneity of a reaction is determined by two factors:***
- the change in [[Enthalpy]] (ΔH)
- and the change in [[Entropy]] (ΔS) of the system.
- The **change in enthalpy** refers to the *change in heat energy of the system* during the reaction, while the **change in entropy** refers to the *change in disorder or randomness of the system.*

 ![[Gibbs free energy change]]
 A reaction may still occur even if it is not spontaneous, but it will require an **input of energy** to *drive the reaction forward*. 
 An example of this is the combustion of wood, which is non-spontaneous at room temperature but can be made to occur by providing an external source of energy, such as a match or a spark.

### Energetics of dissolution
When an ionic solid dissolves, *the strong ionic bonds between the cations and anions are broken, and the ions are surrounded by water molecules that stabilize them by hydrogen bonding.* 

This process is **endothermic** due to the *weaker hydrogen bonding compared to the ionic bonds*. However, the increase in [[entropy]] due to the increased freedom of movement of the ions in solution results in a *highly positive value for ΔS*, making the overall process **spontaneous** with a *negative value for ΔG.*
