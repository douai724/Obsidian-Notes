As most biological molecules are *organic (carbon-based)* it is important to understand the principles of organic chemical reactions to fully appreciate the changes undergone by biological systems.

The detailed process of an organic chemical reaction (i.e. the process of transforming molecules by making and breaking bonds) can be explained and manipulated by using the concepts of **reaction mechanisms**.
