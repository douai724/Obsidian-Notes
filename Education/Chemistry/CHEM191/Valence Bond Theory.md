### Definition
Valence Bond Theory states that when we make a bond between two atoms,→the half filled atomic orbitals will **overlap** and form new orbitals where electron pairs can exist. For $H^2$, the two 1s electrons end up in an orbital made by overlap of the two 1s orbitals ‒ this new orbital is said to have **Sigma** ($\sigma$) symmetry, which means that it is _symmetrical at about the internuclear axis_.

**For H₂**, for example, the two *1s* electrons end up in an orbital made from the **overlap** *of the two 1s orbitals* – this new orbital is said to **have sigma (s) symmetry**, which means that it *is symmetrical about the internuclear axis.*

**For methane (CH4)** things are more complicated. **Overlapping** the *1s orbitals* of the hydrogen atoms with the *half-filled 2p orbitals* on the carbon does not lead to the observed tetrahedral structure with methane is known to have.

Instead, the **2s and 2p valence orbitals on the carbon are hybridised to give a set a four new sp3 hybrid orbitals**. These are oriented at $109.5\textdegree$ to each other, and each contains one of the *carbon’s four valence electrons*. **Overlap** of these with the *1s* orbitals of the four hydrogen atoms successfully gives *four sigma bonds* with the required tetrahedral structure of methane.

### ![[Hybridisation]]
**A *[[covalent bond]]* is basically the sharing of electron density between two atoms as a result of the constructive interference of their atomic orbitals.**

**[[Orbitals]]** tells you the *most probable location* of an electron in an atom. We cannot know the exact location of the electron.
