-   Acid-base Titrations:
	- What is an acid base Titration?→it is an experimental technique used to find the concentration of some species in a solution through its reaction with another species in a solution of known concentration.
	- Common Titration curve order:
		- concentration before Titration (start).
		- Added base ($OH^-$) converts acid into its conjugate base.
		- The acid is neutralised by the base (equivalence point).
		- There is no acid left to react with excess $OH^-$

    -   Diprotic acid
        -   What is the nature of Diprotic acids when titrated?↓
            -   if acid has 2 protons it can donate, it will do so one at a time.
