 **Energy** is the capacity *to do work or transfer heat*
- **Kinetic Energy** is *energy of motion
- **Potential Energy** is the *energy of (relative) position* ‒ chemical bonds act as a store of Potential energy.
- Unit of energy: The unit of Energy is the **joule (J)** ‒ very small amount, often use **(kJ)** instead.
- Energy can be converted from one form to another, but *energy is conserved (not lost) in the conversion*
