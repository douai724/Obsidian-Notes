### Rutherford's model of an atom
Rutherford's (1911) model showed that almost all of the mass in an atom is in the nucleus, the centre of the atom. Which contains the positively charged protons and the neutrally charged neutrons. The negatively charged electrons circulate around the nucleus.

### Schrödinger ‒ [[Quantum Mechanics]]
***showed that electrons exist in orbitals of defined energies***

### Electron Configurations
The Electron Configuration of an atom defines the orbitals in which the atom's electrons lie.

In order of increasing energy (increasing size), the orbitals are: **1s 2s 2p 3s 3p 4s 3d 4p 5s**

The following number of electrons can be paced in these:
- **1s    2s   2p   3s   3p   4s    3d    4p   5s**
- 2e- 2e- 6e- 2e- 6e- 2e- 10e- 6e- 2e-
When chemical bonds form between atoms, it is the *outermost*, or ***Valence electrons*** that are involved. They are the ones in the **orbitals with the highest principle Quantum number.**
