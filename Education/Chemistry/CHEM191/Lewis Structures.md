![[The Octet rule]]

Lewis Structures show the arrangement of electrons as:

**Shared pairs** are *lines*, and the *dots* are **lone pairs**

### Five-steps for drawing a Lewis Structure of a molecule
1. Count the [[Valence electrons]] for each atom.
2. Assemble the bonding framework using single covalent bonds (pairs of electrons) â€’ normally the most electronegative atom in the centre.
3. Place three non-binding pairs of electrons on each outer atom (**Except H**) to achieve _stable octets._
4. Assign the remaining Valence electrons to the inner atoms.
5. Minimise formal charges on all atoms.

In some cases, more than one Lewis Structure can be drawn, i.e. $NO_3^-$. In such cases, the molecule is said to have [[resonance structures]] and the actual bonding is the 'average' of all the possibilities.
