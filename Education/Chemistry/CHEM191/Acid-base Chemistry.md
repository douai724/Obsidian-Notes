#### Lewis Acids and Bases
- A Lewis acid is a proton pair acceptor
- A lewis base is a proton pair donor
#### Brønsted-Lowry Acids and Bases
- A Brønsted-Lowry Acid is a proton ($H^+$) donor
- A Brønsted-Lowry Base is a proton ($H^+$) accepter
- When an acid donates its proton to another molecule, all that remains is called the **conjugate base** of the *acid*. (As it could potentially regain the proton).
- When a base accepts a proton from an acid it becomes a new molecule called the **conjugate acid** Of the *base*.

-   **Acids** are Molecules that contain a Hydrogen atom connected to an electronegative element, common atoms related to this are oxygen or a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I)
-   **Bases** are molecules that contain a lone pair of electrons, usually an oxygen or a nitrogen.
