#### Buffer solutions
There are solutions which contain comparable and reasonable amounts of a weak acid and its conjugate base (or a weak base and its conjugate acid). Solution is able to maintain a (relatively) constant pH when significant amounts of $H_3O^+$ Or $OH^-$ Is added.
##### Two ways to create buffer solutions?
- Mix a weak acid with the sodium salt of its conjugate base or by mixing the weak acid with a small amount of a strong base, this allows some of the weak acid to be converted into its conjugate base.

##### How to calculate the pH of a buffer solution
- For a buffer solution containing weak acid, $HA$, and its conjugate base, $A^-$ 
	- $$pH = pK_a+log\frac {[A^-]} {[HA]}\space or \space pH = pK_a+log\frac {n[A^-]} {n[HA]}$$
	- This equation shows us that, when the concentration (or amounts) are the same, the pH of the buffer solution is equal to the $pK_a$ of the weak acid component.
	- What happens if the buffer uses up all $A^-$ and $HA$? At this point, the pH of the solution will change significantly, and we can say the buffers capacity has been exhausted.
