Different Compounds with the same molecular formula (Same elements but different arrangement)

#### ![[Constitutional Isomers]]
#### ![[Stereoisomers]]
#### Arrangement
The arrangement of the four groups attached to a C=C bond is fixed.
May produce two stereoisomers **(E)-**, **(Z)-**
![[Screen Shot 2023-05-15 at 9.51.37 PM.png]]
- **(Z)-** derived from German ‘together’. *cis*
- **(E)-** from ‘opposite’. *trans*

##### Key rules for isomer arrangement
- **Priorities** assigned to groups *based on atomic number*. 
- *Where two atoms are the same*, consider **what** is attached to each of these. 
- *One atom of higher atomic number* takes precedence over *several of lower atomic number* 
- **Two** atoms of a particular atomic number take precedence over **one** atom of the *same atomic number* 
- **Double bonds** are treated as **two single bonds**, **triple** as **three single bonds**
