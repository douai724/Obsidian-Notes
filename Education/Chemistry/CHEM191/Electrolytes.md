Electrolyte definition: substance that dissolves in a solution to give us ions

Non-Electrolyte definition: substance that dissolves in a solution that doesn't give ions

##### Example of an Ionic Salt
When an ionic salt dissolves in water, the cations and anions of the salt become solvated ([[chemical hydration]]) by water molecules that surround the ion in such a way that the partial positive charged hydrogen atoms in the water stabilize the negative charge of the anion. While the oxygen and its partial negative charge stabilises the positive charge of the cations. These stabilising attractive interactions overcome the energy required to separate the cations and anions within the solid.
