Also known as an ***oxidant***, is a chemical which gains an electron/electrons in an electron transfer process (and so itself is oxidised).

### Biological Oxidants
Chemical vs biological Oxidants
- *Chemical Oxidants are good for many chemical reactions*, but are often themselves toxic to the human body. This is because they are **unselective** and require a low pH.
- *The oxidants that are found in the body are called **coenzymes***, while they enable electron transfer to occur by removing or donating electrons, without a catalyst they act very slowly. (**Selective**)
