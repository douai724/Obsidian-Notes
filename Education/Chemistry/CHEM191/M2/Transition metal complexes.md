A **transition metal complex** consists of some number of **ligands** bonded to a **transition metal cation**. This bond is a coordinate covalent bond, where both electrons come from the ligand. Therefore, _the ligand is a lewis base and the transition metal cation the lewis acid._

### ![[Biological ligands]]
### The influence of the ligand on the transition metal
_Coordination of the ligands modifies the reduction potential of the transition metal ion._ Often complex, in general if the ligand can pull electron density away from the metal ion, it will then have a greater desire for an electron, therefore increasing its reduction potential.
This change can be achieved by varying the ligands, or even by modifying the structure of common ligand structures.
