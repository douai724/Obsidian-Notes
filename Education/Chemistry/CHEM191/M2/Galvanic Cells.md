### Definition
***Galvanic cells*** are electrochemical cells that use an electron transfer reaction to generate electrical energy. 
In a galvanic cell, two different metals are immersed in an electrolyte solution. One metal acts as the **anode** (*the electrode where oxidation occurs*), and the other metal acts as the **cathode** (*the electrode where reduction occurs*). The anode and cathode are connected by a wire, which allows the flow of electrons from the anode to the cathode. *The electrolyte solution allows the transfer of ions between the anode and cathode to maintain electrical neutrality.*

The [[Potential Difference]] between the anode and cathode *drives the flow of electrons through the wire and generates electrical energy*. The greater the potential difference, the greater the amount of electrical energy generated. 

**The amount of electrical energy generated by a galvanic cell can be calculated using the equation:**

##### ***E = (E_cathode - E_anode)***

where **E** is the potential difference (*in volts*), **E_cathode** is the potential of the cathode (*in volts*), and **E_anode** is the potential of the anode (*in volts*).
