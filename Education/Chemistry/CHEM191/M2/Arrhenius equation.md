**This equation combines the collision rate and the collision effectiveness: $$k=A\space e^{-Ea/RT}\space or \space ln(k)=ln(A)-\frac{E_a}{RT}$$**
**A** is called the frequency factor and is related to the probability of the reaction molecules colliding in the correct orientation.

_Experimentally,_ $A$ and $E_a$ can be measured by plotting the variation.

_Alternatively,_ you can measure k at two different temperatures and substitute into this version of the Arrhenius equation: $$ln(k_1)-ln(k_2) = ln\frac {k_1}{k_2}=\frac {-E_a}{R}\Bigg( \frac {1}{T_1}-\frac {1}{T_2}\Bigg)$$
#### Transition state
*A **transition state** in chemistry refers to a hypothetical high-energy state that molecules must pass through during a chemical reaction.* It is an **intermediate** state between the reactants and the products that occurs at the **highest** point on the reaction energy profile, where the molecules have partially broken and partially formed bonds.
