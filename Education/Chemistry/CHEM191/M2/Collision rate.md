### Definition
Chemical reactions involve the **collision** of reactant molecules, Therefore the rate depends on the *rate of collisions and the effectiveness of those collisions*.

**The collision rate measures the number of collisions between reactants A and B per second: *Collision Rate =* $Z_{AB}$**

#### Molecularity
Defines the *number of molecules that must collide for a reaction to occur.*
- A **molecularity of *1*** is classed as *unimolecular*
- A **molecularity of *2*** is classed as *bimolecular*
- A **molecularity of *3*** is classed as *termolecular* (unlikely)

The **effectiveness** of the collisions is determined by the energy of the molecule. They must have energy greater than the **activation energy**.

#### Activation Energy 
Refers to the amount of energy that molecules must overcome to undergo a chemical reaction. In other words, it is the energy required to break the bonds between atoms in the reactant molecules and initiate a chemical reaction.
