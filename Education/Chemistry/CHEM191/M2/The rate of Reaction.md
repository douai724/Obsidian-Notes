## Definition 
It is the *rate at which a chemical reaction occurs and can be measured by how the concentration of a product or reactant changes over time*. This rate is measured in $mol\space L^{-1}\space s^{-1}$.

***What the rate of reaction can be affected by:***
- The chemical nature of the reaction
- Physical states of the reactants and products
- Concentrations of the reactants
- Temperature
- Presence of a catalyst or an inhibitor
