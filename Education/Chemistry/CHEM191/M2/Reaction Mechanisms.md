### Elementary Steps
Every chemical reaction occurs in a series of **elementary steps**: each elementary step describes a collision between molecules. Elementary steps are normally unimolecular or bimolecular.

[[The rate of Reaction]] depends on the nature of these elementary steps, not on the overall chemical equation.

Elementary steps may involve the formation of **reaction intermediates**, species which play a role in the conversion of reactants to products but do not appear in the overall chemical equation.

The **reaction mechanism** is a series of→elementary steps ‒ the sum of the elementary steps in the reaction mechanism must be the same as the overall chemical equation.

#### Experimental vs predicted rate law
- experimental = experimental rate law
- proposed mechanism = predicted rate law
- while the predicted rate law might be consistent with the experimental rate law, there is no way to prove that is correct.

##### Rate Determining Step
The **Rate Determining Step** is the elementary step which is slower than all the others, this controls the overall rate of reaction.
