If an element undergoes an ***increase*** in [[Oxidation]] number, it is being **oxidised**.

If an element undergoes a ***decrease*** in oxidation number, it is being **reduced**.

When atoms exist as an element, their oxidation number is **zero**.

The ***oxidation number*** on a *monatomic (one atom) ion* is the **same as the charge on the ion.**

*[[Hydrogen]] in compounds have the oxidation number* **one**.

*[[Oxygen]] in compounds have an oxidation number* of **-2** (except for hydrogen peroxide).

The ***sum*** of the *oxidation numbers* of atoms in a molecule is **zero**.
The **_sum_** of the *oxidation numbers* of atoms in a polyatomic ion is **equal to the charge on the ion.**
