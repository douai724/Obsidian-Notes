1. **Water**, this is the *most abundant ligand* in biological systems and is highly important for biological function. In most cases they form octahedral, complex ions. These coordinated water ligands then can undergo reaction.
2. **Amino-acids**, individually they can act as *chelating ligands*, either through the amino and carboxyl groups (at high pH), or through the side chains by including donor atoms.
3. **Heme-based ligands**, A heme unit is a cyclic tetradentate ligand with four nitrogen donor atoms. ![[Pasted image 20230513230930.png | 100 ]]
