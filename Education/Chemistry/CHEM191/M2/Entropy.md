## Definition
It is found that both endothermic and exothermic reactions can be spontaneous, another factor, **entropy change** ($\triangle S$) is important.

***Entropy*** can be defined as the *measurement of the number of possible arrangements of particles in a system*. It can also be defined as *the number of possible energies of particles in a system.*

### Second Law of Thermodynamics

*Any spontaneous process will increase the entropy of the universe.* This means that there can be a decrease in entropy in a system, as long as it is offset by an overall increase in entropy in the universe.

***Entropy*** can be measured experimentally, denoted as $S$ or $S\degree$ for an element or a compound. Note: the *standard state for $S\degree$ is not 0*; Units for S are $J\space mol^{-1}\space K^{-1}$.
-   For a chemical reaction, the **change in entropy** can be calculated with the formula:$$\triangle S=\sum nS(products) - \sum nS(reactants)$$
Where **n** is the *stoichiometric coefficient* of each species in a balanced chemical equation, and where **S** is the *molar entropy* of the species. The molar entropy of a substance can be found in tables of thermodynamic data or calculated from experimental measurements.

***The sign of $\triangle S$ can provide information about the spontaneity of a reaction.***
- If ΔS is **positive**, the reaction is said to be entropy-driven or *spontaneous* in the direction of *increasing disorder.*
- If ΔS is **negative**, the reaction is said to be entropy-decreasing or *non-spontaneous* in the direction of *decreasing disorder.*
