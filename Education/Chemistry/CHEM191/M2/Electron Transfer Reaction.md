### Definition
Electron transfer reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one species to another. In these reactions, *one species loses electrons* (**oxidation**) while another *gains electrons* (**reduction**). The species that *loses electrons* is called the **oxidizing agent**, while the species that *gains electrons* is called the r**educing agent**.

## Electron Transfer Reactions under Non-standard Conditions

#### The Nernst Equation
Allows the calculation of ***reduction potentials*** and ***cell potentials*** under *non-standard conditions*.$$E=E\degree - \frac {RT} {nF}lnQ\newline,\space E_{cell}=E\degree _{cell} - \frac {RT} {nF}lnQ$$
- If the **concentrations** of species are *known*, *then the value of $E_{cell}$ / $E$ can be determined.*
- If the electron transfer reaction involves $H^+$ then the reduction potential will vary with pH.

#### Concentration Cells
[[Galvanic Cells]] where the same species are on each side but at different concentrations, This is described as a **concentration gradient.**

#### Membrane Potentials
A biological membrane can separate two solutions of an ion. The resulting concentration gradient generates a membrane potential which can be harnessed by the biological system to do work. i.e. The synthesis of ATP.
