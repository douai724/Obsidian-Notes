***The Gibbs free energy change*** (ΔrG) is a thermodynamic quantity that *describes the spontaneity and direction of a chemical reaction.* It is calculated using the equation:
$$\triangle_r G= \triangle H - T\triangle S$$
Where **ΔrH** is the *change in [[Enthalpy]]* (heat content) of the system during the reaction, **ΔrS** is the *change in [[Entropy]]* (degree of disorder) of the system during the reaction, and **T** is the *temperature* in Kelvin.
